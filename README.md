# <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jon-uldrick/">Jon Uldrick</a>'s IT and Cybersecurity Project Portfolio 🔐

I’m passionate about IT and cybersecurity, and I enjoy building solutions that solve real-world problems. My portfolio highlights my most significant project — an application built with .NET MAUI — along with my ongoing work in the Cyber Range, where I practice and document vulnerability management, threat hunting, and other security operations skills.

## 🛡 Cyber Range Work (Ongoing)

I am actively enrolled in the [Skool Cyber Range](https://www.skool.com/cyber-range), where I practice real-world cybersecurity scenarios and document my progress.  

### Areas of Focus  
- **Vulnerability Management** – Identifying, assessing, and remediating security weaknesses  
- **Threat Hunting** – Investigating anomalies and building detection strategies  
- **Incident Response** – Practicing response workflows in simulated attack scenarios  
- **Security Research** – Exploring adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)  

### Projects & Repositories

#### 📝 Vulnerability Management
- **[Vulnerability Management Program](https://github.com/IamSpotted/Vulnerability-Management-Program)**  
  Documentation and scripts for identifying and remediating vulnerabilities in simulated environments.

#### 🔍 Threat Hunting
- **[Threat Hunting Exercises](https://github.com/IamSpotted/Threat-Hunting)**  
  Sample threat-hunting scenarios, analysis, and detection techniques practiced in the Cyber Range.
